# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions through data preprocessing, comprehensive analysis, visualization, and machine learning models. By exploring and modeling transaction data, the project aims to identify patterns and insights to improve fraud detection accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It includes transaction records with features like amount, time, and anonymized attributes that provide patterns for fraud detection.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Reading & Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and clean data, including handling missing values and duplicates.
   - Normalize and prepare the data for analysis and model input.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explore the data to understand the proportion of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
   - Calculate and interpret key statistics, such as the percentage of fraudulent transactions and average transaction amount.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualize the frequency of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
   - Display the distribution of transaction amounts for both categories to identify patterns in fraud detection.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
   - Assess model performance and identify key insights for improving fraud detection accuracy.

## Requirements
Install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
where `requirements.txt` includes:
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`

## Usage
1. **Load Data**: Import the dataset into the project directory and load it using `pandas`.
2. **Preprocess and Analyze**: Run the analysis scripts to understand data structure and fraud patterns.
3. **Visualize**: Generate visuals to compare fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
4. **Train Model**: Use the scripts provided to train and evaluate models for fraud detection.

## Results
* Key findings include the proportion of fraudulent transactions and insights on transaction amount distribution.
* The best-performing model accurately distinguishes between fraud and legitimate transactions, providing a foundation for further enhancements in fraud detection.
